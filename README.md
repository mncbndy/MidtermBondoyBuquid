## Information Gathering ##
#### Amass ####
* _This package contains a tool to help information security professionals perform network mapping of attack surfaces and perform external asset discovery using open source information gathering and active reconnaissance techniques._
[Video Tutorial]()

####  Dmitry ####
* _DMitry is a UNIX/(GNU)Linux command line application written in C. DMitry can find possible subdomains, email addresses, uptime information, perform tcp port scan, whois lookups, and more._
[Video Tutorial]()

####  Ike-Scan ####
* _ike-scan discovers IKE hosts and can also fingerprint them using the retransmission backoff pattern. ike-scan does two things: a) Discovery: Determine which hosts are running IKE. This is done by displaying those hosts which respond to the IKE requests sent by ike-scan._
[Video Tutorial]()

####  Legion ####
* _This package contains an open source, easy-to-use, super-extensible and semi-automated network penetration testing tool that aids in discovery, reconnaissance and exploitation of information systems. Legion is a fork of SECFORCE's Sparta._
[Video Tutorial]()

####  Maltego ####
* _Maltego is an open source intelligence and forensics application. It will offer you timous mining and gathering of information as well as the representation of this information in a easy to understand format. This package replaces previous packages matlegoce and casefile._
[Video Tutorial]()

####  Netdiscover ####
* _Netdiscover is an active/passive address reconnaissance tool, mainly developed for those wireless networks without dhcp server, when you are wardriving. It can be also used on hub/switched networks._
[Video Tutorial]()

####  Nmap ####
* _Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port scanning techniques, version detection (determine service protocols and application versions listening behind ports), and TCP/IP fingerprinting (remote host OS or device identification)._
[Video Tutorial]()

####  Recon-ng ####
* _Recon-ng is a web-based open-source reconnaissance tool (OSINT) written in Python, often paired with the Kali Linux penetration distribution. The tool reduces time spent harvesting information from open resources and consists of an extensive range of modules and database interaction._
[Video Tutorial]()

#### Spiderfoot ####
* _This package contains an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. Its goal is to automate the process of gathering intelligence about a given target, which may be an IP address, domain name, hostname, network subnet, ASN, e-mail address or person's name._

## Vulnerability Analysis ##

#### Nikto ####
* _Nikto is a pluggable web server and CGI scanner written in Perl, using rfp's LibWhisker to perform fast security or informational checks. Features: Easily updatable CSV-format checks database. Output reports in plain text or HTML._

####  Nmap ####
* _Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port scanning techniques, version detection (determine service protocols and application versions listening behind ports), and TCP/IP fingerprinting (remote host OS or device identification)._
[Video Tutorial]()

####  Unix-privesc-check ####
* _Unix-privesc-checker is a script that runs on Unix systems (tested on Solaris 9, HPUX 11, Various Linuxes, FreeBSD 6.2). It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases)._

 _It is written as a single shell script so it can be easily uploaded and run (as opposed to un-tarred, compiled and installed). It can run either as a normal user or as root (obviously it does a better job when running as root because it can read more files)._
[Video Tutorial]()

#### Burpsuite ####
* _Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities._
[Video Tutorial]()

#### Commix ####
* _Command injection exploiter (commix) is an automated tool written in Python that is pre-compiled in Kali Linux to perform various OS commands if the application is vulnerable to command injection. It allows attackers to inject into any specific vulnerable parts of the application, or even into an HTTP header._
[Video Tutorial]()

#### Skipfish ####
* _Skipfish is an active web application security reconnaissance tool. It prepares an interactive sitemap for the targeted site by carrying out a recursive crawl and dictionary-based probes. The resulting map is then annotated with the output from a number of active (but hopefully non-disruptive) security checks._

#### Sqlmap ####
* _sqlmap goal is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the target host, the user can choose among a variety of options to perform an extensive back-end database management system fingerprint, retrieve DBMS session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, databases, dump entire or user’s specific DBMS tables/columns, run his own SQL statement, read specific files on the file system and more._
[Video Tutorial]()

#### Webshells ####
* _Web shells are the scripts which are coded in many languages like PHP, Python, ASP, Perl and so on which further use as backdoor for illegitimate access in any server by uploading it on a web server. The attacker can then directly perform the read and write operation once the backdoor is uploaded to a destination, you can edit any file of delete the server file. Today we are going to explore all kinds of php web shells what-so-ever are available in Kali Linux and so on._
[Video Tutorial]()

#### Wpscan ####
* _This is a command line tool used in Kali Linux. This tool can be used to find any vulnerable plugins, themes, or backups running on the site. It is usually used by individual WordPress site owners to test their own websites for vulnerabilities and also by large organizations to maintain a secure website._

## Database Assessment ##

#### sqlite database browser ####
* _Its interface is based on QT, and is meant to be used for users and developers that want to create databases, edit and search data using a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, without the need to learn complicated SQL commands. Controls and wizards are available for users to: Create and compact database files._
