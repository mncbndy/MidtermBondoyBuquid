Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the target host, the user can choose among a variety of options to perform an extensive back-end database management system fingerprint, retrieve DBMS session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, databases, dump entire or user’s specific DBMS tables/columns, run his own SQL statement, read specific files on the file system and more._
[Video Tutorial]()

#### Webshells ####
* _Web shells are the scripts which are coded in many languages like PHP, Python, ASP, Perl and so on which further use as backdoor for illegitimate access in any server by uploading it on a web server. The attacker can then directly perform the read and write operation once the backdoor is uploaded to a destination, you can edit any file of delete the server file. Today we are going to explore all kinds of php web shells what-so-ever are available in Kali Linux and so on._
[Video Tutorial]()

#### Wpscan ####
* _This is a command line tool used in Kali Linux. This tool can be used to find any vulnerable plugins, themes, or backups running on the site. It is usually used by individual WordPress site owners to test their own websites for vulnerabilities and also by large organizations to maintain a secure website._

## Database Assessment ##

#### sqlite database browser ####
* _Its interface is based on QT, and is meant to be used for users and developers that want to create databases, edit and search data using a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, without the need to learn complicated SQL commands. Controls and wizards are available for users to: Create and compact database files._

#### Sqlmap ####
* _sqlmap goal is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the target host, the user can choose among a variety of options to perform an extensive back-end database management system fingerprint, retrieve DBMS session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, databases, dump entire or user’s specific DBMS tables/columns, run his own SQL statement, read specific files on the file system and more._

## Password Attacks ##

#### CeWL ####
* _CeWL (Custom Word List generator) is a ruby app which spiders a given URL, up to a specified depth, and returns a list of words which can then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper. Optionally, CeWL can follow external links._
[Video Tutorial]()

#### Crunch ####
* _In order to hack a password, we have to try a lot of passwords to get the right one. When an attacker uses thousands or millions of words or character combinations to crack a password there is no surety that any one of those millions of combinations will work or not. This collection of a different combination of characters is called a wordlist. And in order to crack a password or a hash, we need to have a good wordlist which could break the password. So to do so we have a tool in kali Linux called crunch_

* _crunch is a wordlist generating tool that comes pre-installed with Kali Linux. It is used to generate custom keywords based on wordlists. It generates a wordlist with permutation and combination. We could use some specific patterns and symbols to generate a wordlist._

However, most people don’t really understand the specific attacks that they are vulnerable to. So in this article, We are going to learn about Password Attacks. Password Attacks means a third party trying to gain access to your systems by cracking a user’s password,it may sound illegal but it depends on us whether we want to use it for good things or bad things. Password Attacks are useful in various Cyber Events as well as we can perform it on our own system in case we forgot the password. In this article, we are going to perform brute force attacks with the help of the Medusa tool in Kali Linux._

In addition, there are a collection of common and uncommon passwords that are still or were once used by real people. Remember, you can also create your wordlist if you prefer to or stick to the ones already compiled. Wordlists are derived from data breaches such as circumstances where the company gets hacked. Data stolen from the hacked companies are leaked on websites such as Pastebin or sold on the dark web._
