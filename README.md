## Information Gathering ##
#### Amass ####
* _This package contains a tool to help information security professionals perform network mapping of attack surfaces and perform external asset discovery using open source information gathering and active reconnaissance techniques._

####  Dmitry ####
* _DMitry is a UNIX/(GNU)Linux command line application written in C. DMitry can find possible subdomains, email addresses, uptime information, perform tcp port scan, whois lookups, and more._

####  Ike-Scan ####
* _ike-scan discovers IKE hosts and can also fingerprint them using the retransmission backoff pattern. ike-scan does two things: a) Discovery: Determine which hosts are running IKE. This is done by displaying those hosts which respond to the IKE requests sent by ike-scan._

####  Legion ####
* _This package contains an open source, easy-to-use, super-extensible and semi-automated network penetration testing tool that aids in discovery, reconnaissance and exploitation of information systems. Legion is a fork of SECFORCE's Sparta._
[Video Tutorial]()

####  Maltego ####
* _Maltego is an open source intelligence and forensics application. It will offer you timous mining and gathering of information as well as the representation of this information in a easy to understand format. This package replaces previous packages matlegoce and casefile._

####  Netdiscover ####
* _Netdiscover is an active/passive address reconnaissance tool, mainly developed for those wireless networks without dhcp server, when you are wardriving. It can be also used on hub/switched networks._
[Video Tutorial]()

####  Nmap ####
* _Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port scanning techniques, version detection (determine service protocols and application versions listening behind ports), and TCP/IP fingerprinting (remote host OS or device identification)._

####  Recon-ng ####
* _Recon-ng is a web-based open-source reconnaissance tool (OSINT) written in Python, often paired with the Kali Linux penetration distribution. The tool reduces time spent harvesting information from open resources and consists of an extensive range of modules and database interaction._
